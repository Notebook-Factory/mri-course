# Magnitude and phase data processing for multi-TE gradient-echo MRI
Author: Nan-kuei Chen
* The goal is to demonstrate post-processing methods commonly used for multi-TE gradient-echo imaging data:
    1. exponential fit of magnitude signals
    2. mapping of magnetic field inhomogeneities (i.e., frequency offset) using the phase signals
