# Sensitivity encoded MRI reconstruction
Author: Nan-kuei Chen
* The goal is to demonstrate the use of SENSE reconstruction to recover full-FOV images (i.e., free-from aliasing artifact) from under-sampled k-space data
* The matlab version of this program is described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLqreSDZ4RoXTw0RQiRo72aaZKwjIM-z/view?usp=sharing); and k-space data in matlab format is available in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rz33UxGSabPlTZY9uH77Rb2vlS4R9q8A/view?usp=sharing )
